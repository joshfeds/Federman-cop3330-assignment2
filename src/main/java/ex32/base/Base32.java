 *  UCF COP3330 Summer 2021 Assignment 2 Solution
 *  Copyright 2021 Joshua Federman
 * Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of difficulty.
 * The first level of difficulty would be a number between 1 and 10.
 * The second difficulty set would be between 1 and 100.
 * The third difficulty set would be between 1 and 1000.

Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game.
* The computer picks a random number in that range and prompts the player to guess that number.
* Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to whether the number is
* too high or too low.
* The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses.
* Once the player guesses the correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses and ask
* if the player would like to play again.

Example Output
Let's play Guess the Number!

Enter the difficulty level (1, 2, or 3): 1
I have my number. What's your guess? 5
Too low. Guess again: 7         can do function for isHigher to test
Too low. Guess again: 9
You got it in 3 guesses!

Do you wish to play again (Y/N)? y

Enter the difficulty level (1, 2, or 3): 3
I have my number. What's your guess? 500
Too low. Guess again: 750
Too high. Guess again: 600
Too low. Guess again: 700
Too low. Guess again: 725
Too high. Guess again: 715
Too high. Guess again: 710
Too high. Guess again: 705
Too high. Guess again: 701
Too low. Guess again: 702
You got it in 10 guesses!

Do you wish to play again (Y/N)? n
Constraints
Donâ€™t allow any non-numeric data entry.
During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong guesses.
